Homework for Module 2.  

1.  There are scripts for adding database (such as Excel tables in Module 1):
- [orders.sql](https://github.com/andreikrutov/Data_Learn/blob/main/M_201/orders)
- [returns.sql](https://github.com/andreikrutov/Data_Learn/blob/main/M_201/returns)
- [people.sql](https://github.com/andreikrutov/Data_Learn/blob/main/M_201/people)

2.  We should realize calculation of basic metrics from [Module 1](https://github.com/Data-Learn/data-engineering/tree/master/DE-101%20Modules/Module01/DE%20-%20101%20Lab%201.1#%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B2-excel).
These calculation are in [hw_scripts](https://github.com/andreikrutov/Data_Learn/blob/main/M_201/hw_scripts).

3.  There are three models of Superstore data base. Schemes were made in [SqlDBM](https://app.sqldbm.com/).
- Conceptual

- Logical

- Physical

4.  We should realize these data base on local station and in some cloud system (e.g. AWS). Scripts are in [srcipts for scheme](https://github.com/andreikrutov/Data_Learn/tree/main/M_201/scripts%20for%20scheme) folder.

5. Dashboard for superstore dataset was realized in Google Data studio. The source for this dashboard was in AWS.
